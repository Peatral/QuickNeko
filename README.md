# QuickNeko
This is a silly chrome extension I made in an evening and an afternoon.

It fetches random images from [nekos.life](https://nekos.life) and displays them in a browser action.
You can click the image to go to the next, select different categories, switch between sfw and nsfw
and toggle a slideshow that changes every ~5 seconds to a new image.
